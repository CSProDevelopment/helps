<title>Arc View Shape Files</title> <titleheader />

Arc View Shape files contains polygons, points, or lines used as a geographic layer, together with data for each geographic unit. For purposes of CSPro, only polygon Shape files with the boundaries of administrative units are used.

Shape files are actually collections of three files for each geographic layer: A Shape file (extension .shp) which contains the polygon points, a Database file (extension .dbf) which contains a row of data for each set of polygons, and a Shape Index file (extension .shx) which contains pointers which relate each data row in the Database file to a set of polygons in the Shape file.
