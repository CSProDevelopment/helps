<title>Get Shape Files</title> <titleheader />

<list ordered>
	<li>Shape files probably can be obtained from the geographic unit within your organization or from another organization which uses ArcView or ArcInfo GIS software.</li>
	<li>Get a shape file for each geographic level you want to display, for example one for province and one for district. If you get the province and district levels, you will receive 6 files: PROV.SHP, PROV.SHX, PROV.DBF, DIST.SHP, DIST.SHX, and DIST.DBF.</li>
	<li>Make sure the database (.dbf) file for each shape file contains the name of each geographic unit at that level and the numeric codes for that unit.</li>
