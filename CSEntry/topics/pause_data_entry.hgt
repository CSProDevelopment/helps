<title>Pause Data Entry</title>
<context ID_PAUSE />

To pause data entry press <b>Ctrl+P</b>; click <image pause_button.png /> on the toolbar; or from the <b>Mode</b> menu select <b>Pause</b>.

Whenever you are in <b>Add</b>, <b>Modify</b>, or <b>Verify</b> mode, a timer is running. This timer is used to generate the <link understand_operator_statistics.hgt>operator statistics</link> for the data entry session. <b>Pause (Ctrl+P)</b> stops the timer until you either resume typing or press Ctrl+P again.

The timer affects the calculation of keystrokes/hour. If you need to leave the computer for a few minutes, but are in the middle of a session, you should pause data entry so that time will not be counted against you.
