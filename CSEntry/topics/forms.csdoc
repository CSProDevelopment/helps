<title>Forms</title>

A form appears on the screen when you <b>Add</b>, <b>Modify</b>, or <b>Verify</b> cases. A form contains data <link fields.csdoc>fields</link> and text. Forms may be larger than the actual screen area. The form will scroll automatically to insure that the field you are entering is visible on the screen.

Data entry applications may consist of several forms. As you complete one form the next form is presented. If you move backward from the first field on a form, the previous form is presented.
