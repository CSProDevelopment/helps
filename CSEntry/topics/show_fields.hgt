Sometimes you need to see the values in the data file on the screen. This is particularly useful if you are unsure which case you are verifying or exactly where in the case you are. You can use the <b>Ctrl+F2</b> key to do this. When you press the Ctrl+F2 key you will see the values for all the fields on the current form. You must press Ctrl+F2 again to resume verifying.
