<title>Save Partially Verified Case</title>

In order to save a partially verified case, two conditions must be met.

The most important condition is that during development of the data entry application, the partial feature must have been selected. During verification if you attempt to exit the case by pressing <b>Esc</b> <b>or Ctrl+S</b>, the <b>Partial Save</b> button will appear on the <link stop_data_entry.hgt>Stop Verifying</link> dialog box.

The second condition is that you must have <b>verified</b> all ID fields in the case. If you have, the <b>Partial Save</b> button will be enabled on the Stop Verifying dialog box. Choosing it will save the case, remembering the field your cursor was last on, and returning you to this field when verification is resumed.
