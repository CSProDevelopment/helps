<title>Notes Files (.csnot)</title>

The notes file stores all the notes entered by data entry operators for the corresponding data file. Each note is identified by its case ids and field name. Each record in the .csnot file contains note text for one of the fields. There may be multiple note records for a particular field. All the note text for a particular field follow one another in order in the .csnot file.

Notes for CSPro DB files are stored within the file itself and not in a .csnot file.

The format of the file is described in the <link CSPro::notes_file_csnot.hgt>CSPro Users Guide</link>.
