<title>Finish a Case</title>

Normally you finish a case when you have completed entering all the forms in the case. CSEntry asks you whether you want to accept the case or not. If you accept the case, CSEntry immediately writes the case to the data file.

In <b>system-controlled</b> applications the operator must enter data field-by-field until reaching the end of the case. Exactly when the end of the case is reached is determined by logic. There are no special keys to finish a case prematurely. In applications with more than one level, the application developer must write logic to tell CSEntry when to finish entering level occurrences.

In <b>operator-controlled</b> applications, the operator may press <b>F12</b> or <b>Ctrl-F12</b> to end a case at any time.
