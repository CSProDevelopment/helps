<title>Save Partially Modified Case</title>

In order to save a partially modified case, two conditions must be met.

The most important condition is that during development of the data entry application, the partial feature must have been selected. During modification if you attempt to exit the case by pressing <b>Esc</b> or <b>Ctrl+S</b>, the <b>Partial Save</b> button will appear on the <link stop_data_entry.csdoc>Stop Modifying</link> dialog box.

The second condition is that you must have <b>changed</b> one of the field values in the case. If you have, the <b>Partial Save</b> button will be enabled on the Stop Modifying dialog box. Choosing it will save the case, remembering the field your cursor was last on, returning you to this field when modification is resumed.
