<title>Save Partially Added Case</title>

In order to save a partially created case, two conditions must be met.

The most important condition is that during development of the data entry application, the partial feature must have been selected. During keying if you attempt to exit from your case, the <b>Partial Save</b> button will appear on the <link stop_data_entry.hgt>Stop Adding</link> dialog box.

The second condition is that you <b>must</b> have finished entering the IDs for that case. If you have, the <b>Partial Save</b> button will be enabled on the Stop Adding dialog box. Choosing it will save the case, remembering the field your cursor was last on and returning you to this field when add is resumed.
