<title>Sort a Group Occurrence</title>
<context ID_SORTGRPOCC />

CSEntry allows the operator to sort group occurrences while in <b>Add</b> or <b>Modify</b> mode from any of the fields that belong to the group. For example, if you have a roster or repeating form, and you are currently on one of the fields located within that roster or repeating form, you may sort the data by pressing <b>F5</b>.

The group data will be always be sorted in ascending order. It will sort the data based on the current field selected; that is, based on the location of the cursor. Therefore, if you are in the AGE field of the population group and press F5, the population records will be sorted by age, showing youngest person first.
