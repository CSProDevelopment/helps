<title>Begin Modifying Cases</title>
<context HID_MODIFY />

When you have <link select_a_case.hgt>selected</link> where you want to start modifying cases, press <b>Ctrl+M</b>; from the <b>Mode</b> menu, select <b>Modify</b>; or click <image modify_case_button.png /> on the toolbar to begin modifying. This will begin a new <b>Modify mode</b> session, or pick up where you last left off, if this was a partially modified case. You may move through cases viewing as many as you like, but once you begin modifying a case, you must finish the modify session before you can begin viewing another case.

The session will end when you stop modifying the current case. You can stop modifying a case by <link save_partially_modified_case.hgt>finishing it</link>, or <link save_partially_modified_case.hgt>partially saving</link> the modifications.

Partially modified cases are marked with <image partially_modified_case_icon.png /> in the file tree. You can modify these cases as well as any other completed cases. You cannot modify partially added or verified cases.
