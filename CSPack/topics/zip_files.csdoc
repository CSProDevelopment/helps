<title>ZIP Files</title>

<link https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZIP_(file_format)>ZIP files</link> are used to compress files. A ZIP file has the extension .zip. 

Windows provides built-in support for extracting ZIP file contents, but you can also use other ZIP file programs, such as <link https://www.7-zip.org>7-Zip</link> or <link https://www.winzip.com>WinZip</link>, to extract or change the files created by CSPack.
