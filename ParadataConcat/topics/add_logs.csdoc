<title>Add Logs</title>

To add files to the list of paradata logs to concatenate, press the <b>Add</b> button or <b>Alt+A</b> and select logs you want to add to the list. You can do this several times to add files from different folders or disk or network drives. The added logs will be placed at the end of the file log.

You can also add logs by selecting, dragging and dropping them from the <b>Windows Explorer</b>. The dropped logs will be added to the end of the file list.

Once a log is in the list, some information about the log is displayed, including how many paradata events are contained in the log.
