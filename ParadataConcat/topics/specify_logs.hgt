<subheader>Output Log</subheader>

The output log is the log that receives the results of the concatenation. Type the full path name of the output log into the box provided or press the <b>Browse</b> button to bring up a file dialog box to search for the path and name of the output log. The output log must be placed on a writable device that has enough room to store the resulting concatenated log.

<subheader>Logs to Concatenate</subheader>

The logs to concatenate is an unordered list of all the logs that will be merged into the output log. The order of the logs in the list does not matter, as the concatenation algorithm sorts events by time to create a sorted output.
