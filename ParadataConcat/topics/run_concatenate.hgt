<title>Run Concatenate</title>

To concatenate the specified logs, press the <b>Run</b> button (or press <b>Alt+R</b> or <b>Ctrl+R</b>). A progress bar shows the names of the logs as they are concatenated.

Before concatenating, you must select at least one input log and the name of an output log. If the output log also appears as an input log, then the events already stored in the output log are retained. If the output log does not appear as an input log, then any events that may exist in the output log file are removed before the concatenation begins.
