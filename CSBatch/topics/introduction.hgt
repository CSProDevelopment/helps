<title>Introduction to Batch Applications</title> <titleheader />

CSBatch allows you to run batch applications in CSPro.  A batch application is any application that reads one file (or set of files), performs operations according to the CSPro logic in the application, and writes a file (or set of files) without any operator intervention. Using a batch application you can change data fields, reformat data files, and generate new data files and reports.

CSPro batch applications are often used to clean (by editing and imputation) your data files. After keying or scanning your data, there will be errors in the data file. This is unavoidable, a combination of human and computer error. It will therefore be necessary to correct the data by writing a series of edit routines (procedures) to systematically and consistently clean your data files.

For examples and methodology on how to develop your edit routines, refer to the United Nations Handbook on Population and Housing Census Edits. For information on how to write, debug, and test your edit routines, please refer to the main CSPro helps.
