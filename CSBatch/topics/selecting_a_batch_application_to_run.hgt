<title>Selecting a Batch Application to Run</title>
<context HIDD_CSBATCH_DIALOG />

When you launch CSBatch from Explorer or the command line, a dialog box will appear asking you to name the batch application you wish to run. This is any application with a <b>.bch</b> extension.

If you launch your batch application from CSPro, this dialog will not appear, as it will just simply run the batch application you are currently viewing.
