<title>Type of Frequency</title> <titleheader />

The <b>Type of Frequencies</b> radio button has two settings:

<list>
	<li><b>Value Sets</b>: Tabulate Frequencies will use whatever value sets are defined for the items you select to determine the ranges that will be shown. If a selected item has no value sets defined, Tabulate Frequencies will automatically make one. If an item has one value set defined, Tabulate Frequencies will use it although it does not appear in the tree on the left. If more than one value set is defined, all value sets will be shown on the tree on the left and automatically selected when you select the item.</li>
	<li><b>Each Value Found</b>: Tabulate Frequencies will show one row for each distinct value of the item that appears in the data. The values will not be grouped in any way. This is a good way to see a more "true" distribution of the data and is particularly helpful in identifying outliers.</li>
</list>
