<title>Method of Saving Selected Items</title>

The setting of the <b>Method of Saving Selected Items</b> radio button determines how items will be stored in the <link save_a_frequencies_specification_file.hgt>frequencies specification file</link> when you save it. This only matters if the dictionary later changes.

<list>
	<li><b>Save Included Items</b> (the default): Each selected item name is saved in the frequencies specifications file. If you later add items to the dictionary and then reopen the frequencies specifications file, the new items will not be selected.</li>
	<li><b>Save Excluded Items</b>: Only items that are NOT selected are saved in the Frequencies specifications file. If you later add items to the dictionary and then reopen the frequencies specifications file, the new items WILL be selected.</li>
</list>
