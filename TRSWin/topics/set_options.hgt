There are two options which can be set with TRS to better control the use of the software.

<list>
	<li><b>Automatic Start</b>: Setting this option remembers the last TRS database (.trs file) which was used. If this option is set, TRS will automatically open the last TRS database which was used. You can change the TRS database by opening a new one.</li>
	<li><b>Warn Before Retrieving</b>: Setting this option causes a warning dialog box to be displayed if more that 12 tables or documents are about to be retrieved. It provides an additional warning that a large number of documents will be opened.</li>
