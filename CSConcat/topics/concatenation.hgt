<title>Concatenation</title> <titleheader />

Concatenation is the joining of things end-to-end. With <b>Concatenate Data</b>, you can join two or more data or text files one after the other to make a single file. In a census or survey it is useful to join together files created by different data entry operators into one large file for batch editing and tabulation. For example, in a population census you will want to join together all enumeration area (EA) files for a district into one file for the entire district. The order of the EAs in the file list will be the order in the output file. You can sort the files on file name, path, data, and size by pressing the headers on the file list.

You can also use <b>Concatenate Data</b> to add files to an existing file. You can do this making the output file one of the input files. The position of output file name in the input file list determines what files are added before and what files are added after the data in the current file.

<b>Unicode Note</b>: The output file has a UTF-8 text encoding regardless of the encoding of the input files. Files with an ANSI encoding will automatically be converted to UTF-8.
