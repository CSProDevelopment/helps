<title>Adding Other Documents</title>

Table retrieval files may also contain documents other than tables. You may wish to include text documents, images or maps for different geographic areas. Any document that can be opened by double clicking on it in the Windows Explorer can be used in a table retrieval file as long as the user of the file has the application capable of reading the file installed on his or her system.
