<title>Organization of Tables</title> <titleheader />

Table retrieval files allow users to search for tables by subject, title and geographic area. For example, a user can query the table retrieval file for all tables and documents having to do with education in a given district and the <b>Table Retrieval</b> tool will display all such documents and tables.

When creating a table retrieval file, you specify a title for each table or other document that you add to the file. You then group the titles by subject so that all documents related a given subject can be searched together. You also specify which geographic area or areas a table or document relates to. Typically there are many tables/documents that share the same title but apply to different geographic areas.

Tables may be added individually or groups of tables may be added by loading a CSPro Table Viewer file (.tbw) or an IMPS Text Viewer file (.tbf). When loading tables from either type of file, geographic areas and titles are assigned automatically, however titles must still be organized into subjects.
