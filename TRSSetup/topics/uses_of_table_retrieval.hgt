<title>Uses of Table Retrieval</title>

The table retrieval system is a data dissemination tool. It provides a way to organize large numbers of tables and other documents so that end users may easily search for tables and documents that they need. It allows for distribution of large numbers of tables in electronic form that would be difficult or impossible to do with traditional printed media.

The table retrieval system system consists of two tools. <b><b>Table Retrieval</b> Setup</b> is used to create table retrieval files. Table retrieval files are viewed using the <b>Table Retrieval</b> tool. <b><b>Table Retrieval</b> Setup</b> is used by the producers of tables and related documents to create the table retrieval file. The file is then distributed to end users along with the <b>Table Retrieval</b> tool usually, on flash drive, CD, or other electronic media. Any user with a computer may then search for and view the tables and documents.
