<title>Install and Use Plugins</title>

Users can create plugins for the Paradata Viewer. One such plugin is the <b>Location Mapper</b>, which displays maps that show the GPS coordinates stored in paradata logs, allowing you to track interviewers.

You can create your own plugin, or you may learn of a plugin designed by someone else. To install a plugin, select <b>Plugin Manager</b> from the <b>Tools</b> menu. If you have a plugin file on your computer, select the <b>Browse for Plugin</b> button and select the plugin file. Otherwise, enter the website URL where the plugin is stored and then click the <b>Download Plugin</b> button.

The Plugin Manager will attempt to install the plugin. Once successfully installed, the name and the location of the plugin will be displayed. If you uncheck the checkbox next to the name of the plugin, it will be disabled but still maintained. To completely remove a plugin, select the <b>Remove Plugin</b> button.

Once a plugin is installed and enabled, it will appear on the <b>View</b> menu. The behavior of plugins is not guaranteed by the U.S. Census Bureau, and it is important to view any terms of use distributed by plugin authors.
