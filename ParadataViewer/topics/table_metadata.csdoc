<title>Use the Table Metadata Browser</title>

The Table Metadata Browser is accessible by selecting the appropriate option from the <b>View</b> menu, or by pressing <b>Ctrl + H</b>. The Table Metadata Browser is for advanced users who want to look at the details of the SQL tables stored in a paradata log. Each table is listed, and by clicking on the table, you can view information about the table's columns. By clicking on a table column, you can view any codes that are associated with that column's values.

The information displayed by the Table Metadata Browser comes from the set of three <i>metadata</i> tables stored in the paradata log.

In the <b>SQL Query Builder</b> section, a few options allow you to customize a SQL query that returns the results of the selected table. These options are described in the <link settings.csdoc>settings</link> and <link table_browser.csdoc>Table Browser</link> helps. You can click on <b>Execute in Query Constructor</b> to see the results of the query.
