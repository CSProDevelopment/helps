<title>Use the Table Browser</title>

The Table Browser is accessible by selecting the appropriate option from the <b>View</b> menu, or by pressing <b>Ctrl + B</b>. The Table Browser is for advanced users who want to look at the details of the paradata event tables and any associated tables. Many of the <link settings.hgt>modifiable settings</link> relate to use of the Table Browser.

The tables are initially listed by category, though they can also be alphabetized. To view a table, click on the name of the desired table. The displayed tables can be saved to Excel format.

Paradata events are linked to a base event table, which links to an application, session, and case instance table. To show the most fully linked tables, the <b>Include the base event's instance links</b> option allows you to view everything related to a paradata event. This option results in tables with an abundance of columns, so this is only for advanced users.
