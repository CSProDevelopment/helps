<title>Modify the Filters</title>

The left side of the Paradata Viewer window contains some filters that you can use to filter your reports or queries. You may see a warning if the Paradata Viewer feature that you are using does not support filters.

To filter the data, use the mouse to click on the appropriate filter. You will see a list of the values that exist in your paradata log for that filter. Clicking on any of the values will toggle whether or not the feature includes in its results paradata events that include those values. For example, if your paradata log was shared between two data entry programs (household and individual questionnaires), you can use the <i>Application Name</i> filter to look at the data for only one of those programs.

To enable or disable a value, click on the checkbox next to the value. To select only that value, you can click on the value while holding down the <b>Ctrl</b> button. By right-clicking on a value, a context menu will appear and you can select all values, select only that value, or select all but that value.

To reset the selected filters, right-click on the filter title and choose <b>Select All</b>, or click on <b>Reset Filters</b> at the bottom of the screen to stop using all of the filters. When right-clicking on a filter title, you can also copy to the clipboard the SQL query used to get the list of the values, which advanced users may find useful.
