CAPI entry applications are almost always created in system controlled mode. because they take advantage of CSPro's ability to use logic to determine the question order.

To get started, it is a good idea to define sections containing sets of questions related to one topic. The number of sections will vary from survey to survey. You might need a section to begin the interview and a section to end the interview. You also might need some help sections with FAQ or roster of persons in household.

Next you need to develop an order of the sections, that is the order of the interview. Some sections like FAQ or person roster may be independent of the interview sequence, and may best be placed after the last subject matter section or after the end of the interview section.
