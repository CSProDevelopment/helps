<title>Data Entry Application File (.ent)</title>

The data entry application file is the master file for data entry application. This file specifies all other files contained in the application, along with other information. CSPro allows you to open, close and save data entry application files. When you do so, all other files associated with the application are also opened, closed or saved.

The data entry application file is a <link JSON_specification_files.csdoc>JSON specification file</link> that may be viewed with any text editor, such as Text Viewer or Notepad. It is not recommended to make changes to this file outside the CSPro environment. Advanced users might do so, however, to change the names of associated files from the CSPro assigned defaults.
