<title>Use Multiple Languages</title>

If your application supports <link using_multiple_languages.hgt>multiple languages</link>, then two CAPI question text windows will be shown. Use the drop down list in the toolbar above each question text window to select a language. Each question can have text for each language, although this is not required.

If your CAPI application supports multiple languages, consider starting by entering text for all the questions in the first language. Then use can translate each text into the other languages by putting the first language in the top question window, and translating in the bottom question window. You can also copy and paste between question text windows.
