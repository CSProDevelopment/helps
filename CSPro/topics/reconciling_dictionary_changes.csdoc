<title>Reconciling Dictionary Changes</title>
<context IDD_RENAMEDLG />

Whenever you make changes to a data dictionary, CSPro must reconcile the changes in applications that use the dictionary. If the application is open when you make the change, CSPro automatically makes the change in your application. If the application is not open, CSPro will attempt to make any changes the next time you open the application.

Under some circumstances CSPro will ask you to assist in the reconciliation process. You may asked whether you want to delete item from a form or rename the item, that is, use an item with a different dictionary name.

To rename the item, select "Rename" and then choose the new item name from the list presented. To delete the item, select "Delete."
