<title>Map Results by Geographic Area</title>

If a digitized map of the country is available to the user, CSPro can be used to produce thematic maps from one or more values in a tabulation. In many cases, such maps are more effective in communicating information, particularly to the lay public, than are tables. For example, if the table shows the geographic distribution of a particular resource (for example, persons holding post-secondary degrees by sex), these values can be imported into the <link MapView::introduction_to_map_viewer.hgt>Map Viewer</link>; the thematic map generated can often dramatically illustrate existing conditions, particularly where the distribution of the resource is uneven.
