<title>Binary Data Entry Application File (.pen)</title>

<list>
	<li>A binary data entry application file is an alternative to distributing the entire suite of the data entry application files. It is a single binary file that contains all the information from your data entry application's dictionaries, forms, logic, message file, and CAPI question text.</li>
	<li>While this file is <link generate_binary_data_entry_application.hgt>generated</link> within the CSPro Designer, it cannot be read by the CSPro Designer. It is read by CSEntry, on either desktop or mobile devices. A .pen file cannot be viewed with a text editor.</li>
	<li>Binary data entry application files provide security during a data entry operation. If you install a .pen file to your data entry operators' workstations, the operators cannot change the application, even if they have the full CSPro installed on their machines.</li>
	<li><b>.pen</b> files are the only type of file you can install on an Android device.</li>
	<li>Binary data entry applications created in versions of CSPro prior to version 6.0 used the extension .enc, not .pen. These files cannot be read by CSEntry versions 6.0 or higher.</li>
