<title>Binary Data Entry Application File (.pen)</title>

<list>
    <li>A binary data entry application file (<b>.pen</b>) is an alternative to distributing the entire suite of the data entry application files. This is useful if you do not wish for others to modify your application or view the underlying logic. A single binary <b>.pen</b> file contains all the information from your data entry application's dictionaries, forms, logic, message file, and CAPI question text needed to run the application.</li>
    <li>While this file is <link generate_binary_data_entry_application.csdoc>generated</link> within the CSPro Designer, it cannot be read by the CSPro Designer nor a text editor. It can only be read by <b>CSEntry</b>, on either desktop or mobile devices. </li>
    <li>Binary data entry application files provide security during a data entry operation. If you install a <b>.pen</b> file to your data entry operators' workstations, the operators cannot change the application, even if they have the full CSPro program installed on their machines.</li>
    <li><b>.pen</b> files are the only type of file you can install on an Android device.</li>
    <li>Binary data entry applications created in versions of CSPro prior to version 6.0 used the extension .enc, not .pen. These files cannot be read by CSEntry versions 6.0 or higher.</li>
