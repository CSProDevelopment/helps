<title>Paradata Log File (.cslog)</title>

Paradata log files contain information about <link paradata.hgt>paradata</link> events stored during an application's run. Files created using this type have the extension .cslog and are not text files so they cannot be viewed in <link tool_list.hgt>Text Viewer</link>.

You can use the <link ParadataViewer::introduction_to_paradata_viewer.hgt>Paradata Viewer</link> to view the contents of the file. Advanced users can also query paradata logs by using the <logiccolor>paradata</logiccolor> logic function or by generating a <link templated_reports.hgt>templated report</link>.

You can combine multiple paradata logs into a single log by using the <link ParadataConcat::introduction_to_paradata_concatenator.hgt>Paradata Concatenator</link> tool.
