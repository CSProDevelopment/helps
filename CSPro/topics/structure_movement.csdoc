<title>Structure Movement</title>

Decide what movements within the case, an interviewer will be allowed to make. For example, will the interviewer only be allowed to move backwards or forward through the interview questions or will they be allowed to jump around. If they can jump around, what jumping movements will they be allowed to make. Are there sections that must be completed first? Are there optional sections that don't have to be filled in? Are there sections that can be completed in any order?

Decide what happened when the interviewer tries to stop the interview before it is completed? Will this be allowed? If it is, how will the interview be ended? Through an end section, which may collect when the respondent will be free to continue the interview and where interview notes may be inspected? Or by just remembering the current question being asked?

If an interview can be continued at a later time, how will the interview be restarted? By just advancing to the last question completed? Or by having the interviewer ask a few questions to reorient the interviewer and respondent.
