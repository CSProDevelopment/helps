<title>Using Multiple Languages</title>

CAPI respondents often speak different languages. In fact, it is not uncommon to find several languages spoken among the households included in a survey. It is advantageous for your entry application to accommodate the different languages that respondents might speak, since doing so will improve data quality and response rates.

CSPro supports multiple languages, and lets you <link use_multiple_languages.csdoc>add languages</link> and define question text for each. By default, just one language (marked as English) is available. You can define additional languages and then <link enter_question_text.csdoc>enter question text</link> for each as needed.

During the interview, the interviewer can switch among the application's languages on-the-fly. Each question's text will be displayed at the top of the screen, in the chosen language. So, if an interviewer arrives at a household and finds that the respondents prefer to conduct the interview in another language, this can be easily done.

When you develop a multi-language application, it is probably easiest to finalize and test all the question texts in one language. Then, once this is done, language specialists can translate them into the other languages your application will support. This is easy to do, since the question text editor can display question text for two languages at the same time. The translator can copy and paste text or bitmaps, if needed. Finalizing all the question text in one language first also helps avoid version control problems that might arise if things were translated then later modified.
