<title>Compile Logic</title>
<context HIDD_DLGCMPL />

When CSPro compiles your logic, it checks the logic you have written to see if there are any errors or warnings. Typical errors including spelling a command incorrectly, not using proper command syntax, and putting logic in the wrong place. Error messages appear in the panel at the bottom of the screen and a red dot appears to the left of the line that contains the error. Typical warning usually involve using commands in questionable ways. Warning messages also appear in the panel at the bottom of the screen and a yellow dot appears to the left of the line that contains the warning.

You can choose to compile code for a specific item, or for the entire application. To compile code for a specific item, simply select that item from the tree on the left side of the screen. The associated logic for that item will be displayed in the <b>Logic View</b>. Press <image compile_button.png /> on the toolbar; or from the <b>File</b> menu, select <b>Compile</b>; or press <b>Ctrl+K</b>. The results of your compile will be displayed in the <b>Compiler Output</b> area at the bottom of the screen. When you are ready to compile the entire application, select the topmost entry of the <link data_entry_tree.hgt>data entry tree</link> or <link batch_edit_tree.hgt>batch edits tree</link>. This will display all logic written for the application in the <b>Logic View</b>. You can then press the compile button or press <b>Ctrl+K</b>.

CSPro always compiles your application when you run the <link run_a_data_entry_application.hgt>data entry</link> or <link run_a_batch_edit_application.hgt>batch edit</link> application. If there are errors, you cannot proceed until the errors are corrected.
