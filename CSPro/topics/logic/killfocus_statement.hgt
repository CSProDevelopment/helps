<subheader>Description</subheader>

The <logiccolor>killfocus</logiccolor> statement declares that the statements following it are executed when a form, roster, or field <b>stops</b> being active.

Statements in an <logiccolor>killfocus</logiccolor> procedure are executed when you move off the object in which they are coded. When moving <b>forward</b>, any <logiccolor>killfocus</logiccolor> statements are executed before any <logiccolor>postproc</logiccolor> statements. However, when moving <b>backward</b>, the <logiccolor>postproc</logiccolor> statements are <b>not</b> executed and only the <logiccolor>killfocus</logiccolor> statements are executed.

The <logiccolor>killfocus</logiccolor> statement is not very common as most logic operations and checks only occur when moving forward in the application, in which case they can be coded in a <logiccolor>postproc</logiccolor>.

<subheader>Example</subheader>

<logic>
PROC CEB_MALE

killfocus

	CEB_TOTAL = visualvalue(CEB_MALE) + visualvalue(CEB_FEMALE);
</logic>
