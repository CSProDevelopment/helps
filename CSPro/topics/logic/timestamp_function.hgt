<subheader>Description</subheader>

The <logiccolor>timestamp</logiccolor> function returns the UNIX time, which is, in Coordinated Universal Time (UTC), the number of seconds that have elapsed since January 1, 1970. This value is used by many computer programs and is thus useful for storing times as well as calculating timespans. Because the time is in UTC, it eliminates the need to worry about time zones when working with times.

<subheader>Return Value</subheader>

The function returns the UNIX time as a decimal value. The integer part of this value is the number of elapsed seconds, while the decimal part contains the milliseconds. If you wish to store this value in a dictionary variable, a numeric variable should be defined with the following properties: LEN=13, DEC=3, DEC CHAR=0.

<subheader>Example</subheader>

<logic>
PROC GLOBAL

numeric surveyStartTime;

PROC CROPS_QUEST

preproc

	surveyStartTime = timestamp();

postproc

	SURVEY_DURATION = timestamp() - surveyStartTime;
</logic>
