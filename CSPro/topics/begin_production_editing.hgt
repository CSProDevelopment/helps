<title>Begin Production Editing</title>

If no changes to the CSPro program are needed, only the <b>Run</b> program step needs to be executed for each batch of data to be edited. If the data dictionary is changed, then you must re-compile the program before running it again. During production processing, edit statistics for each run should be checked to ensure that the number of errors and imputations are within the normal range.

As soon as enough batches have been edited to form a larger geographic area (perhaps all enumeration areas within a district), tabulations should be run at the higher geographic level (in this case, district) to see if any inconsistencies are apparent. If so, it will be necessary to pause and discover the reason for the inconsistencies. This may involve modifying and re-testing the CSPro program until the data are producing satisfactory results. Each time the CSPro program is modified, all previously-edited batches must be re-edited (always starting with the same original data files!) so that final data will all have been edited and corrected following the same logic.
