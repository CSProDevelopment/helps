<title>Application Properties File (.csprops)</title>

A data entry, batch edit, or tabulation application can contain a file that stores application properties. This optional file has the extension <b>.csprops</b>. The file will be associated with an application when a user <link properties_application.csdoc>changes properties</link> away from their default settings. With these property settings externalized in a file, it is possible to share properties across multiple applications.
