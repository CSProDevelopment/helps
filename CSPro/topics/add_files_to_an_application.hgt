<title>Add Files to an Application</title>
<context ID_FILE_ADD_FILE />

You may add dictionaries and form files to a <link data_entry_applications.hgt>data entry application</link>. Additional dictionaries represent data files used by the application, such as lookup files. Multiple forms files are sometimes used in advanced applications. You may not add files to tabulation applications.

To insert a file, from the <b>File</b> menu, select <b>Add File</b>. Select an existing file or enter the name of the file to be created.
