Numbers may be any positive or negative integer or decimal value. Negative numbers have a leading minus (-) sign. Positive numbers have no sign, but can have an optional leading plus (+) sign. Numbers can have up to 15 significant digits. Numbers must not have thousands separators. Decimal points can be either period (.) or comma (,) depending on the "Regional Options" setting of the computer.
