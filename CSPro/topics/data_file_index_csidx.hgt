<title>Data File Index (.csidx)</title>

The data file index is a binary file that contains an index of case IDs used by CSEntry to ensure that each case has a unique set of case IDs. It is also used to locate cases in applications using external files. An index is only created for <link data_sources.hgt>text files</link>. Prior to CSPro 7.0, the data file index had the extension .idx.
