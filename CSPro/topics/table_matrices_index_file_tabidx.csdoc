<title>Table Matrices Index File (.tabidx)</title>

A table matrices index file (.tabidx) contains indices for a <link table_matrices_file_tab.csdoc>table matrices file</link> with the same name. While it is not necessary to save these files, because they can be recreated, having them around makes tabulation processing go faster.
