<link CSFreq::introduction_to_tabulate_frequencies.hgt>Tabulate Frequencies</link> is a CSPro tool that allows you to display a frequency distribution of a dictionary variable(s) based on its value set(s). For example, you could have defined several value sets such as "age in 5 year groups," "level of education," or "type of occupation." Tabulate Frequencies gives you both the numeric count and percentage distribution for the selected variables. It also gives the cumulative distributions.
