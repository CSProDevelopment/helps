<title>Starting Position</title>

This item property indicates the starting location of a data item. In conjunction with the <link item_length.csdoc>Length</link> property, it specifies the location of the item in a record. In <link relative_and_absolute_mode.csdoc>absolute</link> positioning mode, you cannot give a starting position that will cause the item to overlap with another item.

The start position of a <link sub_items.csdoc>subitem</link> must be within its parent item (the previous item).
