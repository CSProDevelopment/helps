<title>Frequency File (.frq)</title>

If your program contains any impute statements, the results of this command will be written to this file. The default file extension is .frq, but you can use whatever extension you prefer. This field is optional, so if your program contains impute commands but you do not specify a frequency file, no file will be generated. Similarly, if you indicate a frequency file but your program does not contain any impute commands, no file will be generated.
