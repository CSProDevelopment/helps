<title>Item Description</title>

An item describes the response to a question or helps <link questionnaire_and_dictionary_organization.hgt>identify</link> the questionnaire. The item is the most basic element of a questionnaire: age, income, and crop code are all examples of items. Related items should be placed in the same record. And, just like records and levels, data items possess properties (such as a unique name, label, etc).

An item can be redefined into <link sub_items.hgt>subitems</link>.
