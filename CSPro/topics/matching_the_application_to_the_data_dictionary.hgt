<title>Matching the Application to the Data Dictionary</title>

Whenever an existing application is specified, the system automatically checks to make sure the application matches the data dictionary. This is to alert you in case a change was made to the data dictionary after the application was last saved, or in case you typed in the wrong data dictionary name.

If the application does not match, the system will indicate that discrepancies exist and will ask you to permit the updating of the application. If you prefer not to accept the update or if you wish to first investigate the cause of the discrepancy, you may answer <b>No</b> and the system will not open or update the application. You can then verify that you have the correct dictionary and review any changes that might have been made since the last time the application was opened.
