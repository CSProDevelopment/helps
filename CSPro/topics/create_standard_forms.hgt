Frequently, CAPI applications format question text using one or two specific fonts. CSPro has two dedicated font selections (CAPI font 1 and CAPI font 2) that can be defined and used for this purpose.

<list ordered>
	<li>Select <b>Change CAPI Font 1</b> or <b>Change CAPI Font 2</b> from the <b>CAPI Options</b> menu.</li>
	<li>A font dialog will appear, where you can change the font type and size. You can also change the font formatting (underline, boldface, italic) and color.</li>
