<title>Generate Default Data Entry Forms</title>
<context ID_GENERATE_FRM />

CSPro can automatically generate data entry forms that places all dictionary items onto forms. This can save time as it quickly builds up your form(s), allowing you to easily customize them to your specific needs. One form will be created for each dictionary record (identification items get their own form as well). Thus, for a one-level dictionary that contains at least one level ID and three other records, you will end up with four forms.

To generate new data entry forms, either press <b>Ctrl+G</b>; or, from the <b>Edit</b> menu select <b>Generate Forms</b>; or from the dictionary tab on the left side of your screen, drag the dictionary onto a form. As this action will destroy all existing forms, a warning message will appear, asking you to confirm that you wish to proceed.

If you choose to proceed, the <link drag_option_menu.csdoc>Drag Option</link> dialog will appear. At this point you have the opportunity to decide text placement with respect to the data entry boxes; whether you want to <link data_entry_elements.csdoc>roster</link> items (when possible); whether you want <link sub_items.csdoc>subitems</link> dropped instead of the item, etc.
