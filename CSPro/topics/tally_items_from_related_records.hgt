<title>Tally Items from Related Records</title>

Data items on different records are often linked or related via codes on each of the records. For example, in a labor force survey there may be an initial roster of information about each household member followed by an additional set of questions for persons 15 years old and over. If a table involves age and sex from the initial roster and an economically active recode from the supplemental form, the data must be somehow linked so that the tally is done correctly. CSPro allows the definition of <link relation_description.hgt>relations</link> in the data dictionary, which will link these two related records for the purpose of creating cross tabulations.
