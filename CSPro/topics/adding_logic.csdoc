<title>Adding Logic</title>

In most surveys, <link consistency_edits.hgt>consistency errors</link> are corrected <link methods_of_correcting_data.hgt>manually</link> as opposed to <link methods_of_correcting_data.hgt>automatically</link>. The correction process, as done traditionally, is often very lengthy, time-consuming and painful. In surveys of small volume and high complexity, such as Household Surveys or Income and Expenditures Surveys, it is often desirable to apply the <link guidelines_for_correcting_data.hgt>edit specifications</link> rules at data entry time and resolve any errors immediately while the questionnaire is still at hand. This approach is not recommended for a census.

You can use the CSPro language to write consistency checks for virtually any part of your data entry application's <link dictionary_hierarchy.hgt>level</link>, <link data_entry_elements.hgt>form</link>, <link data_entry_elements.hgt>roster</link>, or <link data_entry_elements.hgt>field</link>. The logic is executed as the data is being keyed. Any error messages are reported back on the screen, and the operator then has access to both the <link errors_at_data_entry.hgt>error messages</link> and the questionnaire itself on the screen. The same logic can be run against the data after they are entered in either batch or interactive mode.
