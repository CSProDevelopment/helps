<title>Names</title>

Names identify the dictionary and its elements when they are referenced in CSPro procedures. Names are required for the dictionary and most of its elements. Names consist of upper case letters (A-Z), digits (0-9), and embedded underscores (_). The first character of a name must be a letter; the last character cannot be an underscore.

Names can be any length but must not be CSPro <link list_of_reserved_words.hgt>reserved words</link>. Names cannot be duplicated within a dictionary. However, the same name can be used in different dictionaries, and in some cases, it maybe desirable to do so.

<b>Examples</b>: <font monospace>SEX, RELATIONSHIP, MOTHER_ALIVE, Q102_AGE_CHILD</font>

The dictionary tree displays either the <link labels.hgt>labels</link> or names of dictionary elements. You can press <b>Ctrl+T</b> or from the <b>View</b> menu, select <b>Names in Trees</b> at any time to toggle between labels and names.
