The <arg>encoding</arg> argument allows you specify how the contents of the file are <link unicode_primer.csdoc>decoded</link> to text. There are few cases where this may be necessary, as the default of reading UTF-8 text will generally meet the needs of most users. Options include:

<list>
	<li><logiccolor>"ANSI"</logiccolor>: The contents are decoded as part of the <link "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_code_page">Windows code page</link>.</li>
	<li><logiccolor>"UTF-8"</logiccolor>: The contents are decoded as <link unicode_primer.csdoc>UTF-8</link>, regardless of whether there is a byte order mark (BOM).</li>
	<li><logiccolor>"UTF-8-BOM"</logiccolor>: The contents are decoded as <link unicode_primer.csdoc>UTF-8</link>, regardless of whether there is a BOM.</li>
</list>
