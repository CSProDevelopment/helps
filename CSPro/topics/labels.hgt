<title>Labels</title>

Labels are descriptive text used to identify the dictionary and its elements. Labels are required for the dictionary and most of its elements. Labels can contain any printable character and spaces and can be up to 255 characters long.

The <link data_dictionary_tree.hgt>dictionary tree</link> displays either the labels or <link names.hgt>names</link> of dictionary elements. You can press <b>Ctrl+T</b> or from the <b>View</b> menu, select <b>Names in Trees</b> at any time to toggle between labels and names.
