<title>Batch Edit Application File (.bch)</title>

The batch edit application file is the master file for a <link batch_edit_applications.csdoc>batch edit application</link>. This file specifies all files used by the application, along with other information. CSPro allows you to open, close, and save batch edit application files. When you do so, all other files associated with the application are also opened, closed, or saved.

The batch edit application file is a <link JSON_specification_files.csdoc>JSON specification file</link> that may be viewed with any text editor, such as CSPro's <b>Text Viewer</b> tool or Notepad. It is not recommended to make changes to this file outside the CSPro environment. Advanced users might do so, however, to change the names of associated files from the CSPro assigned defaults.
