<title>Coming Back Later</title>

You need to think about what behavior will be needed if an interview is continued at a later time. That is, should they start again from the beginning of the instrument, the place where the last interview left off, or something else. Sometimes instruments will always go through a front section to confirm household member names and other vital information and then jump to the section where the earlier interview ended.
