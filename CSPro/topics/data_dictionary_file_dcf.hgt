<title>Data Dictionary File (.dcf)</title>

Each data file manipulated by CSPro must be described by a data dictionary. The data dictionary file contains information defining the layout of a data file, including levels, records, items, value sets and values.

CSPro allows you to explicitly open, close and save data dictionary files independently of other application files. You must be careful when you do so if more than one application uses the data dictionary.

CSPro applications may optionally contain data dictionaries which represent secondary files, such as <link external_files.hgt>lookup</link> files, which are opened during data entry.

The data dictionary file is a text file which may be viewed with any text editor, such as Text Viewer or Notepad. It is not recommended to make changes to this file outside the CSPro environment.
