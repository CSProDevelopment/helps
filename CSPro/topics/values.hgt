<title>Values</title>

A CAPI application can optionally show a pop-up box containing an item's valid values. This makes it easier for the interviewer to read and select response categories. The pop-up box appears to the side of the item, so a response could also be typed in. The list of responses that appears comes from the item's first value set.

If you decide to use this feature, be sure to create descriptive value sets for your questions, since these will be displayed as during the interview.
