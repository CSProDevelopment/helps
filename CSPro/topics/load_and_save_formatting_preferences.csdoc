<title>Load and Save Formatting Preferences</title>

CSPro has a predefined set of formatting standards built into the system; these would be considered "Defaults." These include the text font, its colors, its indentation, its alignment, etc. Users have the option of creating their own defaults called "Preferences." These Preferences can be saved and reused for other applications. They may also be shared among multiple users working on the same publications in order to keep consistent formatting for all tables produced by that team.
