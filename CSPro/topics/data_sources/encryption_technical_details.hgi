Encrypted CSPro DB files are SQLite files encrypted using the <link "https://www.hwaci.com/sw/sqlite/see.html">SQLite Encryption Extension (SEE)</link> using "AES-256 in OFB mode." The specified password is not used as the key input to SEE but is instead <link CS_Hash_createHash.csdoc>hashed</link> to create a 256-byte key that is used to encrypt the file. If allowed, this hash, not the password, is <link dictionary_security_options.csdoc>cached on the machine</link>. A fixed salt is used during the hashing process because there is no suitable place to store a dynamic salt. This means that the same password will always result in the same encryption key.
