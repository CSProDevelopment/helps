This data source is similar to None except that all cases persist in memory for the duration of the program run (or rather, until the data source is closed), meaning:
<list>
<li>CSEntry shows any cases added to the repository until CSEntry closes</li>
<li>After adding a case using an external dictionary using writecase, it can be retrieved with loadcase as with a data file</li>
</list>

<subheader>Limitations</subheader>
<list>
	<li>Does not support binary data </li>
	<li>Does not support undeleting cases </li>
	<li>Does not support opening as external dictionary when file has duplicate keys </li>
	<li>Does not support syncing data </li>
</list>
