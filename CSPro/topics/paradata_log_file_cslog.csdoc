<title>Paradata Log File (.cslog)</title>

Paradata log files contain information about <link paradata.csdoc>paradata</link> events stored during an application's run. Files created using this type have the extension <b>.cslog</b> and are not text files so they cannot be viewed in <link tool_list.csdoc>Text Viewer</link>.

You can use the <link ParadataViewer::introduction_to_paradata_viewer.csdoc>Paradata Viewer</link> to view the contents of the file. Advanced users can also query paradata logs by using the <logiccolor>paradata</logiccolor> logic function or by generating a <link templated_reports.csdoc>templated report</link>. Paradata can be synchronized between devices or servers by using the <logiccolor>syncparadata</logiccolor> function.

You can combine multiple paradata logs into a single log by using the <link ParadataConcat::introduction_to_paradata_concatenator.csdoc>Paradata Concatenator</link> tool.
