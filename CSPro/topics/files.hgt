<title>Files</title>

Files whose structure is defined by a data dictionary are automatically declared by their dictionary names. Files that do not have associated data dictionaries and need to be named at run time are defined by the <logiccolor>file</logiccolor> statement. Such files can be used in the file manipulation functions such as <logiccolor>fileread</logiccolor>, <logiccolor>filewrite</logiccolor>. They can also be used in <logiccolor>export</logiccolor> statements.

The <logiccolor>file</logiccolor> statement gives a name to a file that is local to that application. The physical name of the file is requested in the Define File Associations dialog when the application is run, or by using the <logiccolor>setfile</logiccolor> function.
