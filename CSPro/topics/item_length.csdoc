<title>Length</title>

This item property indicates the total length of the data item (i.e., the number of characters necessary to represent the values for the item). In conjunction with the <link starting_position.csdoc>Start</link> property, it specifies the location of the item in a record. In absolute positioning mode, you cannot give a length that will cause the item to overlap with another item.

The maximum length of a numeric item is 15 digits. The maximum length of an alpha item is 255 characters.
