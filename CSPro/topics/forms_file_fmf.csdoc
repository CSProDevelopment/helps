<title>Forms File (.fmf)</title>

The forms file contains information about forms, their fields, text and rosters. The forms file also contains the name of the associated data dictionary file. Fields and rosters have links into the data dictionary. The flow during data entry, that is, the order in which forms and fields are entered, is defined in the forms file, not in the data dictionary.

CSPro allows you to explicitly open, close and save forms files independently of the application file. When you do so, the associated data dictionary file is also opened, closed or saved. Note that if you open a forms file you will not have access to its application's logic. Generally, only advanced users open forms files explicitly.

The forms file is a text file which may be viewed with any text editor, such as Text Viewer or Notepad. It is not recommended to make changes to this file outside the CSPro environment. Advanced users might do so, however, for example to change the name of the associated data dictionary file.
