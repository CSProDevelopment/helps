<title>Code Edits of Individual Data Items</title>

Edit specifications need not be assigned to team members in any specific order. It is recommended that the simpler edits be coded first, especially if the coding is being done by inexperienced program mers. In this manner, they will gain experience and will later be able to handle more complex edits.

Team members should code the edit specifications and review the code with the team leader. The team leader should then incorporate the new code into the CSPro program. All syntax errors should be corrected before more code is added to the main program. It is important to maintain earlier versions of the program as insurance against problems that may creep in.
