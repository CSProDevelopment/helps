To view options related to CSPro advanced features, select <link properties_application.hgt>Application Properties</link> from the <b>Options</b> menu of a data entry, batch edit, or tabulation application, and then select the <b>Advanced Features</b> section.

These options allow customization of advanced CSPro features. These features may not be available in a future release. Options include:


<b>Use HTML dialogs</b>: If checked, CSPro will use <link html_in_cspro.hgt>HTML</link> dialogs for displaying logic functions (such as <logiccolor>errmsg</logiccolor> and <logiccolor>accept</logiccolor>) as well as other aspects of the CSPro user interface (UI). If unchecked, CSPro will use the style of dialogs used prior to CSPro 7.7. In a future release of CSPro, the old style of dialogs will be removed.
