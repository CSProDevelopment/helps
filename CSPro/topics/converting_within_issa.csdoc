<title>Converting within ISSA</title>

In an ISSA data entry application, a dictionary file contains both descriptive information about each data item (item type, item length, etc), as well as information about the form layout. However, in CSPro, we break this information into two separate files. Therefore, if you:

<list>
	<li>Convert an ISSA data dictionary to CSPro data dictionary only, you will receive a CSPro dictionary (.dcf) only. You can choose to convert either a regular data dictionary (.dic) or a working storage dictionary (.wst).</li>
	<li>Convert an ISSA data dictionary to CSPro form and data dictionary, you will receive both a CSPro dictionary (.dcf) and a CSPro form file (.fmf). You can choose to convert either a regular data dictionary (.dic) or a working storage dictionary (.wst).</li>
