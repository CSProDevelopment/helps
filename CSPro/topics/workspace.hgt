<title>CSPro Workspaces</title>

With the introduction of the dictionary's <link dictionary_property_panel.hgt>Property Panel</link> in version 7.7, there is a need for a term to describe the element listing area that appears on the right hand side of the dictionary window (or now center area if the dictionary's Property Panel is active). This area will be referred to as the <b>workspace</b>. 

While the property panel will eventually make its way into <link data_entry_applications.hgt>Data Entry</link> and <link batch_edit_applications.hgt>Batch Edit</link> applications, it does not yet exist there. Nevertheless, we can still use the <b>workspace</b> term to refer collectively to the logic + message areas found within the <link data_entry_forms_screen_layout.hgt>Forms Designer</link> and <link batch_application_screen_layout.hgt>Batch Edit</link> screens.
