<title>Change Edit Order</title>
<context ID_CUSTOMORDER />

By default, a new batch edit application fixes the order of editing to the order of items in the dictionary. If new items are added to or rearranged in the dictionary, the editing order is determined by the new dictionary arrangement.

To make your own custom order of the editing items within records, you need to do two things: from the <b>Options</b> menu, select "Custom Order"; then drag and drop items in the <link batch_edit_tree.csdoc>batch edit tree</link> into the order you wish the edits to be performed. If you rearrange items within a record in the dictionary, the custom order will not change. If you add new items to a record, the new items will be placed at the end of the record for purposes of editing. If you unselect "Custom Order," the edit order will return to the order of items in the dictionary.
