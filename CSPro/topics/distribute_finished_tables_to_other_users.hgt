<title>Distribute Finished Tables to Other Users</title>

The tables from a tabulation application can be saved in several different file formats. The format you choose depends on what you wish to do with the tables. To include tables in a word processing document, use the rich text format (.rtf). To bring the table data into a spreadsheet so that users can do calculations on it, use the tab-delimited format. To post tables to the web, use the HTML format. If you want your users to be able to use your tables in all of these ways, you can distribute them in the CSPro Table Viewer format (.tbw). Users can then view your tables in the Table Viewer tool and from there they can copy and paste or save tables in any of the formats supported by CSPro. Table Viewer will also allow them to print, and change the formatting of your tables, but it will not allow them to modify the table data.

If the tabulations use area processing, the table viewer files can also be imported into a CSPro Table Retrieval System (TRS). This is a much more structured way to distribute tables, especially for large numbers of tables (or documents, for that matter).
