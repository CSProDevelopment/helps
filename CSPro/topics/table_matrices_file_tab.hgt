<title>Table Matrices File (.tab)</title>

A table matrices file (.tab) contains the output of tabulated numbers from CSPro's tabulation engine. They are row and column contents of the tabulated tables, without any surrounding text.

A table matrices file may also contain the output of the Consolidate process of CSPro, where table matrices for one geographic level are added together to produce table matrices for a higher geographic level.

These files are used as output and input when tabulations are run in parts.
