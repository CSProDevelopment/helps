<title>What is CSPro?</title>
<context HIDR_MAINFRAME />

The <b>C</b>ensus and <b>S</b>urvey <b>Pro</b>cessing System (CSPro) is a software package for entering, editing, tabulating, and disseminating data from censuses and surveys. Using CSEntry, the data collection component, you can run a data entry operation on the Windows, Android, and Universal Windows environments. CSPro combines the features of the Integrated Microcomputer Processing System (IMPS) and the Integrated System for Survey Analysis (ISSA).

CSPro runs under Windows Vista, 7, 8, and 10. It does not run under other operating systems such as Linux or Mac OS. It is a public domain product, so it can be used and distributed at no cost.

CSPro can be used to process data from censuses and surveys, both small and large. Typical subject areas include:

<list>
	<li>Housing and Population</li>
	<li>Demographic Characteristics</li>
	<li>Health and Nutrition</li>
	<li>Agriculture</li>
	<li>Labor Force</li>
	<li>Business Establishments</li>
	<li>Education</li>
	<li>Living Standards</li>
	<li>Energy</li>
	<li>Immigration</li>
	<li>Household Income and Expenditure</li>
	<li>Community</li>
	<li>Institutional</li>
	<li>Post-Enumeration</li>
	<li>Vital Statistics</li>
</list>

CSPro uses data dictionaries to provide a common description of each <link data_sources.hgt>data file</link> used. CSPro encodes data in <link unicode_primer.hgt>UTF-8 format</link>. CSPro provides tools to view data and text files, to view tables and thematic maps created by CSPro, to convert IMPS and ISSA data dictionaries to and from CSPro, and to convert ESRI shape files (maps) to CSPro map files.

CSPro is not intended to provide database management capabilities. However, the data generated and/or manipulated by a CSPro application can be imported into a database system. While CSPro provides some tabulation capabilities, it is not intended to replace more sophisticated statistical analysis software such as R, SAS, SPSS, Stata, etc. In addition, even though CSPro includes a module for generating thematic maps, it cannot be considered a geographical information system (GIS) because the maps cannot show the multiple layers available in a true geographical information system.
