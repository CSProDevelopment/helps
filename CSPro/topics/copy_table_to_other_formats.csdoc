<title>Copy Table to Other Formats</title>

In addition to saving a table file in a particular format (as described in the <link save_tabulations_in_different_formats.csdoc>preceding section</link>), the user can use standard Windows copy and paste functions to copy all or part of a table directly into a word processor or spreadsheet. If only a portion of a table (i.e, not all rows and/or columns) is highlighted, CSPro will automatically include stub and column header text for only the affected rows/columns.
