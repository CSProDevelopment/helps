<title>Undo and Redo Changes</title>
<context HID_EDIT_UNDO HID_EDIT_REDO />

CSPro keeps track (in an "undo stack") of the 12 most recent changes you have made to your application. Please be aware that not all changes can be undone.

If you have made a mistake and want to undo it, press <image undo_button.png /> on the toolbar; or from the <b>Edit</b> menu, select <b>Undo</b>; or press <b>Ctrl+Z</b>. CSPro will try to restore your forms to the state previous to last change you made. To undo the next-to-last change, press the <b>Undo</b> button again.

Sometimes you may undo several changes and realize you have gone too far back. Press <image redo_button.png /> on the toolbar; or from the <b>Edit</b> menu, select <b>Redo</b>; or press <b>Ctrl+Y</b>. Redo is an "undo" of an undo.
