<title>Drop Down / Combo Box</title>

These capture types display all values in the value set of numeric and alphanumeric items. The drop down capture type is identical to the radio button capture type, except that it displays differently on Windows. In contrast, the combo box capture type allows for the displaying of ranges of values (that is, value sets with "to values").

While the drop down and combo box capture types are visually identical on desktop CSEntry, in the mobile environment there is a difference between the two options. Drop down fields, which contain only discrete values, will be displayed as radio buttons. Combo box fields, which can include ranges, will appear as text boxes with a corresponding button that displays the entire value set, allowing users to see the valid ranges as well as to select from discrete values (such as a missing code).
