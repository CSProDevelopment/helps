<title>Sequence Dictated by Designer</title>

In the course of creating the application, the designer may choose to modify cursor movement under certain conditions. In the example of a population census, if data are being captured for a male, or for a female under the age of 15, the application designer may wish to skip over the items relating to fertility because they are not applicable to these population subgroups. If the skip occurs (whether programmed or through operator control), the edit sequence will be modified accordingly. In addition, if the operator moves backward and forward through the forms, the edit sequence may also be affected, depending on the type of control (operator or system).
