<title>Set a File to Only be Updated on First Install</title>

Certain files may only need to be deployed when the application is first installed and should not be modified when the application is updated. For example, a data file containing some initial data that will be modified by the application itself should not be overwritten with the original data when the application is updated. Files marked <b>Only on first install</b> in the deployment package that already exist on the mobile device will not be modified on the mobile device when the application is updated.

To mark a file as <b>Only on first install</b>, right-click on the file in the files tree and select <b>Only on first install</b> in the context menu so that it is checked. To clear the <b>Only on first install</b> setting, right-click on the file and select <b>Only on first install</b> a second time to remove the check mark.
