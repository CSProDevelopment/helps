<title>Viewing CSPro Data Files</title>
<context IDD_DATA_VIEWER_QUERY ID_FILE_OPEN_IN_DATA_VIEWER />

If you are storing your data in a non-text file format (such as <link CSPro::data_source_csdb.csdoc>CSPro DB</link>), it is not convenient to view the data in Text Viewer. You may instead want to view the file in CSPro's <b>Data Viewer</b> tool. This will show the data in an appropriate manner along with information from the dictionary.

When opening a CSPro DB or <link CSPro::data_source_csdbe.csdoc>Encrypted CSPro DB</link> file, Text Viewer will ask you if want to open the file in Text Viewer or Data Viewer. It is recommended that you open the data in Data Viewer.
