<title>Viewing CSPro Data Files</title>

If you are storing your data in a non-text file format (such as CSPro DB), it is not convenient to view the data in Text Viewer. You may instead want to view the file in CSPro's <b>Data Viewer</b> tool. This will show the data in an appropriate manner along with information from the dictionary.

When opening a CSPro DB or Encrypted CSPro DB file, Text Viewer will ask you if want to open the file in Text Viewer or Data Viewer. It is recommended that you open the data in Data Viewer.
