<title>Change Reader Breaks</title>

This option is controlled through the Format (Table) menu.

Reader breaks separate rows of data into readable groupings. This is done by inserting blank rows in the table at the specified intervals.

Select the number of lines (intervals) for each group.

<b>Note</b>: Reader breaks apply to the entire table. Users may need to do additional spacing in the table rows to gain the desired result.
